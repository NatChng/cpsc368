My notes for CPSC 368 - Databases in Data Science at UBC! This class is 1 of 3 (at the time of writing) options that fulfill the database elective as part of UBC's Minor in Data Science program. Here's a table of contents and my personal study tips:

- Chapter 0: Course Intro (not included in notes)
- Chapter 1: Conceptual Design
- Chapter 2: Relational Models
- Chapter 3: SQL Plus
- Chapter 4: Data Warehousing
- Chapter 5: Non-Relational Databases
- Chapter 6: MongoDB
- Chapter 7: Data Mining
- Chapter 8: Data Privacy

## Study Tips!
I found the worksheets and additional class activities to be extremely useful for understanding the course material (especially SQL). Writing SQL queries and evaluating SQL equivalencies forms a substantial component of the course, in my experience, the best way of understanding the logic is to practice. You'll eventually understand some general frameworks to solve specific problem types (ex. when should I use NOT IN? should I use a nested query or view here?) and find out which feels easier for you to understand. Despite having your preferences, it's still important to understand alternative approaches to solving the same problem (using a view vs nested query, NOT EXISTS + EXCEPT vs 2x NOT EXISTS).

Tutorials are useful for understanding how to do certain components of the project and the MongoDB unit! Lastly, I found myself drawing on prior coursework when developing a group research project. My group leveraged our collective experience working with ML models in CPSC 330, but other courses that teach applicable skills include (not limited to): DSCI 100, STAT 201, STAT 301, and CPSC 210.
